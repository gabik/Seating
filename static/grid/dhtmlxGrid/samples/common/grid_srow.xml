			<strong>A Time to Kill</strong> is the name of a legal suspense thriller authored by John Grisham in 1989. Grisham's first novel, it was rejected by many publishers before Wynwood Press eventually gave it a modest 5,000-copy printing. After The Firm, The Pelican Brief, and The Client became bestsellers, interest in A Time to Kill grew, the book was republished by Doubleday in hardcover and then by Dell Publishing in paperback, and became a bestseller as well.

<strong>Stephen King</strong> had such fun recording the epic, unabridged audio version of his haunting novel Bag of Bones, he decided to publish the three-story collection <strong>Blood and Smoke</strong> exclusively on audio. They're horror stories, good and dark, loosely linked by the theme of cigarettes and a macabre humor. The flip-top cigarette-box package is amusingly cool, too. <br/><br/>

In the first tale, "Lunch at the Gotham Café," Steve Davis quits smoking two days after his wife dumps him. King cleverly compares the two kinds of withdrawal: obsession blends with emotional flatness, and you're left "with a feeling the world has taken on a decidedly dreamy cast." Driven, Steve meets with his wife and her lawyer at a midtown Manhattan restaurant, where the nightmare begins. "I was pretty sure something was wrong with the maitre d' almost as soon as I saw him," says Steve, and gothic café events soon prove him right.
